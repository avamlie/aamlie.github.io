<h1> About Me </h1>

  <p style="margin-top: 25px; letter-spacing: .7px; font-size: 18;"> <strong>Hi!</strong> My name is Annika and I am a rising senior at Northwestern University. Throughout my time at NU, I have found a passion for computer science- especially data science, AI, and UX/UI. Having worked in both the e-Commerce and real estate industries, I have experience with building upon software and data analysis devices that are user-friendly. Making technology and data accessible to the common person is something that I am very passionate about, which is also why I have chosen to minor in psychology.</p><p style="letter-spacing: .7px; font-size: 18;">I also enjoy teaching and mentoring others, and my roles as a Peer Adviser, Peer Coach, and Computer Science tutor have allowed me to expand upon my leadership skills. </p>
