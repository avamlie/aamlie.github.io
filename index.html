      <p class="textbox">Hi! My name is Annika Amlie and I am a junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science with minors in Psychology and Dance. Outside of academics, I am a dancer in Boomshaka, Northwestern’s drumming and dancing performance group. I am also a Peer Adviser and a member of Delta Gamma. When I’m not going to rehearsals or meetings, I enjoy listening to music, exploring Evanston and downtown Chicago, and drawing. </div>

      The well-known “Marshmallow Study”, originally conducted by Walter Mischel, Yuichi Shoda, and Philip K. Peake (1990), has been analyzed in multiple contexts, and has since been altered in order to account for different variables. The original study, which found a connection between the delay of gratification and adolescent cognitive development, did not entirely consider the aspect of environment and how it affects a child’s values. After considering the data provided by two similar studies, it is evident that simply waiting a few minutes for two marshmallows is not entirely indicative of future academic achievement, but it is a reflection of the way self-control and discipline are valued in the environments in which children are raised.
